## Problem 
Due to rapidly growing market the sales director at AtliQ Hardwares is facing issues in getting effective insights of the sales happening in North, South and Central zones of India. Because of this he is unable to make data driven decision. 
So as a data analyst my aim was to unlock insights that are not visible to sales team for supporting there decision and eventually automating to reduced manual time which is spent in data gathering,manipulation,etc

## AIMS Grid
Understanding Stakeholders who are involved is also a crucial step. In our case Stakeholders were Sales Director, Marketing Team, Customer Service Team, Data Analytics Team, IT Dept.
